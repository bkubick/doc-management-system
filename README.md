# Document Management System

## Description
A project dedicated to building out a document management system using REACT and microservices through AWS. The purpose of this project is to dive into serverless architectures, specifically through AWS. This project will start by following the pluralsight course [Building Serverless Application on AWS](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skills/building-serverless-applications-on-aws), however, I plan to build upon this to go further into the field of serverless architectures, while building out a resource/tool I can hopefully use.

**NOTE** This repository is just beginning, and is in continuous development.

**NOTE** Here is the course repository that this repo grabs from and follows throughout the course. I have separate directories for each segment of the course, and once I finish the course, I will make my own directory that I will build off of earlier work to make my own customized app to continue building my skill set.
